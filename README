This is the README for pam_krb524, a PAM session module which gets the 
user Kerberos 4 tickets on login using krb524init, and removes them on 
logout.

One uses the module by adding the line

session    optional   pam_krb524.so

in /etc/pam.d/common-session after pam_krb5.so.

It supports the debug option.
